This is the read me for the PAC-2

The idea is simple: 
  > Write code in PAC-2 to read Tiff file.
  > Create Aggregate object and store tiff data in it
  > Create filter, segment, measure and LemmeC objects for doing things
  > Filter and segment the tiff data using segment object
    and store a list of Particle objects in the Aggregate object
  > Analyze particle objects to get gradation, morphology and contact
    orientations using the measure object
  > Write all of the output down in a log file
  > Plot all the figures and store as tiff files for publication using 
    lemmeC object
  > ???
  > Profit!
