In this folder are contained the the subregion information for the resin samples

These samples were scanned from a resin sample collected for a Dense OTC sand
sample after cone penetration experiment was carried out under an applied
surcharge of 50 kPa.

5 scans were carried out-three along the face of the penetrometer, one below the
penetromter tip and one above the penetrometer shoulder.

The subregions are numbered as follows: 
1-Above shoulder
2-Near Shoulder
3-Middle of cone face
4-Cone tip
5-Below cone tip

For scans 1 and 5, 9 subregions will be analyzed
For scans 2-4, 6 subregions will be analyzed.

Total subregions analyzed will be 36 around the cone penetrometer.
