'''This code takes the feret psd and the value of particle volume loss and calculates the relative breakage value

The relative breakage is calculated using the Hardine (1985) definition. The reason for this is that the the largest particle in the subrgegion can be smaller than the largest particle in the original sample

Since in the analysis, we also remove small particles that are smaller than 1000 voxels in volume, we correct the gsd to take in to account the removed particle

If the percentage passing for a particle size "i" in the uncorrected PSD is "p_uncorr_i" and the percentage of particles removed is "p_small," then the corrected percenage passing "p_corr_i" is computed as:
	p_corr_i = ( p_uncorr_i + p_small )/( 100 + p_small ) * 100
