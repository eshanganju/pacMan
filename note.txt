Things to do:
    0. Local location for subregion extraction
    1. Filteration of the extracted subregions
    2. Particle size distribution:
        2.1. Binarization - how?
        2.2. EDM and WSS.
        2.3. Over-segmentation correction.
        2.4. Removal of edge particles. 
    3. Relative breakage parameter calculation.
    4. Position wrt sholder.
    5. Relative breakage contours.

Approach:
    Locating the subregions can be manual or auto.
    Manual is by  creating new files using fiji.

    Extraction of subregion
      The images will be corrected (inverted) in fiji
      From fiji, we will get location of subregions extracted.
