Things to do:
    0. Local location for subregion extraction
    1. Filteration of the extracted subregions
    2. Particle size distribution:
        2.1. Binarization - how?
        2.2. EDM and WSS.
        2.3. Over-segmentation correction.
        2.4. Removal of edge particles.
    3. Relative breakage parameter calculation.
    4. Position wrt sholder.
    5. Relative breakage contours.

Extraction of subregion
  The images will be corrected (inverted) in fiji
  From fiji, we will get location of subregions extracted.

Extraction of subregion done - updated the reader module to read file sequence and extract 
    subregions from the images.
    The subregions are references according to the top left corner of subregion
    As it is easy to see subregion in Fiji that way.

Filteration - using non local means filter.
    Other filter methods exit
        Median
        Mean
    We use the non local means filte
        It prevents damage to edges in the 3dTomo - Vlahinic.
        Explanation: https://youtu.be/Va4Rwoy1v88
    Added the Code for filteration
    Need to update for multiple files

How to binarize without knowing the density.

Options:
    1. Use Otsu's method
          No closed loop control
          May over estimate the sample density

Targets
    1. Binarization method code
        1.1 Approaches - Otsu's, Visual, Fonseca modified.
        1.2 Known gradations, checking with 1D scans.
    2. Checking if method works - using 1D sample as example
    3. Watershed segmentation
    4. QC and correction of oversegmentation size dependent
        4.1 Estimation of error for particles smaller than threshold
        4.2 Method to compute the error
    5. Generation of relative breakage contours

Presentation:
    1. Outline - CT analysis method.
    2. Binarization method update.
    3. Simple example.
