Observed large amount of noise in the data collected during the resin scans.•
The noise was removed by using non-local means filter, with a patch size of 
5 pixels and a search distance of 7 pixels. Also, the hval was set to 1.5 image
of the centerslice. This was found to improve the image quality a lot-without 
removeing the information at the particle edges (check noise removed)
