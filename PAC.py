Outline: 
PAC - Particle Analysis Code I wanted to call it PACman, but cant find any way of using those 3 letters
Contact me ganju.eshan@gmail.com if you do. This code analyzes static CT scans for particle properties 
(does not track particle)

Features:
    1. Filter tiff stack of CT data
    2. Binarize tiff stack of CT data
    3. Segment tiff stack of CT data
    4. Determine particle size parameters of segmented data
    5. Determine particle morphology parameters of segmented data
    6. Determine particle contacts and fabric tensor of segmented data
    7. Determine particle and void orientation

Classes:
    1. Particle
    2. Aggregate
---
    3. Filter
    4. Segment
    5. Measure
    6. Visualize

Naming conventions:
    Class names: concatenated words each starting with upper case
    Objects, ivars, methods: concatenated words, first word all lower case, subsequent words starting with upper case

# %% DATA option #1 - Kalisphera spheres

'''
Use this segment if testing functionality of code
Use next segment if using collected CT data
---
This section uses data from spam.datasets (sdata).
Data is in the form of DEM spheres: The centeres, radius and box size are taken from loadDEMboxsizeCentreRadius
The data is used to create touching spheres using kalisphera tool developed by [1], which acounts for PVE
The generated data is passed through a gaussian and a noise filter to make it similar to data colllected from X-Ray CT
The example is slightly modified after [2]

1. Use the edm and local maxima from 
    from skimage.morphology import local_maxima as localMaxima
    locMax = localMaxima(aggregate.euclidDistanceMap) # gives true value for local maxima
2. Read through locMax and assign each True value a integer number (starting from 1) and each False 0
3. Pass locMax and edm to watershed algorithm
    from skimage.morphology import watershed as wsd
    labelled = wsd()
